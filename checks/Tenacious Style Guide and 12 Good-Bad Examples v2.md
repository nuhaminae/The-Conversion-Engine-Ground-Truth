**Tenacious Style Guide v2**

*Tone markers, formatting rules, and 24 labeled outreach drafts*

# **Purpose**

This guide codifies the Tenacious voice and provides 12 labeled "good" and 12 labeled "bad" outreach drafts. The labeled drafts are training data for the agent's tone-preservation check and reference material for any team member writing email or LinkedIn outreach in the Tenacious voice.

The drafts are anchored to real Tenacious context: the four ICP segments (recently-funded Series A/B startups, mid-market platforms restructuring cost, engineering-leadership transitions, specialised capability gaps), the four hiring signals (funding event, job-post velocity, layoffs, leadership change), the AI maturity score (0–3), the four-stack bench composition (Python, Go, data, ML, infra), and the public pricing bands.

# **The Five Tone Markers**

Every outreach, every reply, every discovery-call context brief must preserve these markers. A draft that scores below 4/5 on any marker is regenerated. A draft that fails two or more markers is a brand violation.

### **1\. Direct**

Clear, brief, actionable. No filler. Subject lines state intent — "Request," "Follow-up," "Context," "Question" — never "Quick," "Just," or "Hey." Body of cold outreach: 120 words maximum. One clear ask per message.

### **2\. Grounded**

Every claim is supported by the hiring signal brief or the competitor gap brief. When a signal is weak (fewer than five open roles, single low-confidence input), the agent asks rather than asserts. "Three open Python roles since January — is hiring velocity matching the runway?" not "You're scaling aggressively."

### **3\. Honest**

Refuses claims that cannot be grounded in data. Never claims "aggressive hiring" if the job-post signal is weak. Never over-commits bench capacity that bench\_summary.json does not show. Never fabricates peer-company practices to make a competitor gap brief look sharper. When a signal is missing, names the absence and asks.

### **4\. Professional**

Language appropriate for founders, CTOs, and VPs of Engineering. Avoids internal jargon — "bench" reads as offshore-vendor language to a prospect. Use "engineering team," "available capacity," or "engineers ready to deploy." Never uses offshore clichés ("top talent," "world-class," "A-players," "rockstar," "ninja").

### **5\. Non-condescending**

Frames competitor gaps as research findings or questions worth asking, never as failures of the prospect's leadership. Senior engineering leaders know their own gaps; they do not need a cold email to point them out. The value is the specificity of what peers are doing, not the implication that the prospect is behind.

# **Formatting Constraints**

* **Body length:** Cold outreach max 120 words. Warm reply max 200 words. Re-engagement max 100 words.

* **One ask per message.** No stacking "and also would love to discuss X, Y, s."

* **Subject line under 60 characters.** Gmail truncates above this on mobile.

* **No emojis in cold outreach.** Permitted in warm replies if the prospect sets the tone first.

* **No marketing taglines in signature.** Name, title, Tenacious, gettenacious.com. Nothing else.

* **No attached PDFs in cold outreach.** Send links inline only after the prospect has expressed interest.

* **Re-engagement emails carry new content,** not guilt. No "following up again" or "circling back." Add a new signal, a new question, or a new data point.

# **Channel Rules**

| Channel | When to use |
| :---- | :---- |
| Email (primary) | Cold outreach. Warm replies. Proposal and contract follow-up. The default channel for every Tenacious prospect. |
| LinkedIn DM | Permitted only when the prospect's email is unavailable, when the signal is recent enough that LinkedIn timing matters (a leadership change announcement within seven days), or when the prospect has engaged with Tenacious content in the last 14 days. Never used as the first touch for a Series A/B founder unless email has bounced or returned no contact. |
| SMS | Only after the prospect has replied at least once and confirmed SMS is acceptable for scheduling. Never as a cold first touch. |
| Voice | Discovery call only, booked through Cal.com, delivered by a human Tenacious delivery lead. The agent never voice-calls a prospect. |

# **Pre-flight Checklist Before Any Outreach Goes Out**

The agent runs through this list before sending. A failed item triggers regeneration or human review.

| Check | Pass condition | Fail behavior |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Hiring signal grounding | At least one signal from the brief is referenced specifically (named funding amount and date, named role count and trend, named layoff event, named leadership change with date). | Regenerate. A draft with no specific signal is a tone failure on Grounded. |
| Confidence-aware phrasing | If the signal confidence in the brief is "Medium" or "Low," the draft uses interrogative or conditional language ("is hiring velocity matching the runway?", "if you're scoping additional capacity"). If confidence is "High," assertive language is permitted. | Regenerate. Asserting on weak signal is a tone failure on Honest. |
| Bench-vs-engineering-team language | The word "bench" does not appear in any prospect-facing message. Acceptable substitutes: "engineering team," "available capacity," "engineers ready to deploy." | Regenerate. "Bench" externally is a tone failure on Professional. |
| Bench-to-brief match | If the draft commits to capacity (a number of engineers in a stack, a start date), the commitment is supported by bench\_summary.json. If the brief asks for capacity that the bench does not show, route to human, do not commit. | Replace commitment with a discovery-call routing line. |
| Pricing scope | If the draft mentions price, it is from the public quotable bands in pricing\_sheet.md (junior monthly floor, mid-tier monthly, starter project floor, hourly blended). Total contract values for multi-phase engagements are not invented. | Replace specific number with band, route to discovery. |
| Word count | Cold body ≤ 120 words. Warm reply ≤ 200 words. Re-engagement ≤ 100 words. Subject ≤ 60 characters. | Trim. If trimming requires removing the signal grounding, regenerate. |
| One ask | Body has one explicit call to action. Common asks: 15-minute scoping call, reply with current bottleneck, send PDF resource, no-action FYI. | Pick the highest-value ask, drop the others, regenerate. |
| Banned phrase scan | None of the banned phrases (see list below) appear in subject or body. | Regenerate. |
| LinkedIn-roast test | If the email were screenshot and posted on LinkedIn with the prospect's annotation, would Tenacious be roasted? If yes, regenerate. | Regenerate. |

# **Banned Phrases**

These phrases do not appear in any Tenacious outreach. The agent's banned-phrase regex check fails the draft if it sees any of them.

| Phrase | Why banned |
| :---- | :---- |
| world-class | Marketing filler, unfalsifiable. |
| top talent | Offshore-vendor cliché, signals low quality. |
| A-players | Same as above. |
| rockstar / ninja / wisard | Outdated vendor jargon. |
| skyrocket / supercharge / 10x | Aggressive growth promises with no substantiation. |
| I hope this email finds you well | Generic, signals template. |
| just following up / circling back | Re-engagement filler with no new content. |
| Quick question / Quick chat | "Quick" implies the recipient's time is owed. |
| synergise / synergy / leverage / ecosystem | Consultant jargon. |
| game-changer / disruptor / paradigm shift | Hype with no substance. |
| our proprietary \[X\] system / our AI-powered \[X\] | Black-box claims that invite skepticism. |
| You'll regret missing this / Don't miss out | Fake urgency. |
| Per my last email | Passive-aggressive. |
| our 500 employees / our 20 years of experience | Self-centered, irrelevant to the prospect's signal. |
| I'll keep this brief — but \[long paragraph\] | Performative concision that fails. |
| I noticed you're a \[job title\] | Generic — the title alone is not a signal. |

# **Twelve Good Drafts (Labeled)**

Each draft is grounded in at least one named hiring signal and follows all five tone markers. The metadata below each draft names which segment, which signal, and which Tenacious service line the draft fits.

 

| GOOD \#1 — Series A funding \+ role velocity, high signal confidence |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| Subject | Request: 15 minutes on your Q3 Python hiring |
| **Body** | Hi Maya, You closed your $14M Series A in February and your open Python engineering roles went from 2 to 7 in the last 60 days. The typical bottleneck for teams in that state is recruiting capacity, not budget. We place dedicated Python and data engineers, managed by Tenacious, with a minimum three hours of synchronous overlap. We can plug a team in within 48 hours while you continue your full-time search. Would 15 minutes next week be useful? I'll bring two case studies from Series A SaaS clients who hit the same wall. Best, Yabi Research Partner, Tenacious Intelligence Corporation gettenacious.com |
| **Why it works** | Names the funding amount and date, and the exact role-count trend. Both are verifiable. Frames the gap as a *typical* pattern, not a personal failing of the prospect. One ask: 15 minutes. No stacking. Avoids the word "bench" — uses "team" and "plug a team in." Names a concrete value-add for the call (two relevant case studies), not a vague "discuss synergies." Body 89 words, subject 39 characters. |
| **Signal grounding** | ICP Segment 1 (recently-funded Series A/B startups). Primary signal: funding event, 120 days ago. Secondary: hiring velocity tripled. Confidence: High on both. |
| **GOOD \#2 — Post-layoff cost-pressure pitch, mid-market restructuring** |  |
| Subject | Context: lower-cost engineering capacity post-restructure |
| **Body** | Hi Daniel, I saw the announcement that your team contracted by about 12% in March. Companies in your stage often need to maintain delivery output while reducing fully-loaded cost — that is the engagement pattern we run most often. Tenacious places managed engineering teams under our project management. Senior engineers in Python, data, and ML start from $X,XXX/month, with a one-month minimum and two-week extension blocks. No long-term commitment. If you are scoping the next twelve months of delivery capacity, I can share two short case studies from mid-market clients who replaced a portion of their delivery cost this way. Best, Yabi Research Partner, Tenacious Intelligence Corporation gettenacious.com |
| **Why it works** | Acknowledges the layoff specifically and respectfully — names it as "contraction," not as a failure. Frames the pitch as a *pattern* Tenacious sees often, removing personal sting. Quotes only public-tier pricing bands and the 1-month minimum from pricing\_sheet.md. Conditional language: "If you are scoping…" — does not assume need. Body 100 words. Avoids "bench," "top talent," and any urgency framing. |
| **Signal grounding** | ICP Segment 2 (mid-market platforms restructuring cost). Primary signal: layoffs.fyi, 45 days ago, 12% headcount cut. Secondary: post-layoff hiring posts indicating skill rebalance. Confidence: High. |
| **GOOD \#3 — New CTO 90-day vendor reassessment window** |  |
| Subject | Context: a brief on offshore engineering models |
| **Body** | Hi Priya, Welcome to your new role at Helix — I saw the announcement on the 14th. New engineering leaders typically reassess vendor and offshore mix in their first 90 days. I do not want to add to your inbox in week three of a new job. I will leave you with one thing: a one-page brief on the four offshore engagement models we see most often, with the trade-offs honestly laid out (including where each model fails). If a 15-minute conversation in November would be useful, the calendar is at gettenacious.com/yabi. If not, no follow-up. Best, Yabi Research Partner, Tenacious Intelligence Corporation gettenacious.com |
| **Why it works** | Names the leadership-change announcement date specifically. *Self-aware*: acknowledges it is a noisy moment, lowers the ask. Offers a real value-add (one-page brief with honest trade-offs *including failures*) rather than a generic case study. Explicit "if not, no follow-up" — shows respect for time. Body 96 words. No banned phrases. No assumed need. |
| **Signal grounding** | ICP Segment 3 (engineering-leadership transition). Primary signal: new CTO announcement, 18 days ago. Secondary: none required — the leadership change alone is the buying-window signal. Confidence: High. |
| **GOOD \#4 — Capability gap, AI maturity score 2 with high confidence** |  |
| Subject | Question: your MLOps function in 2026 |
| **Body** | Hi Felix, Three companies adjacent to yours in the loyalty-platform space — A, B, and C — posted senior MLOps engineer roles in the last 90 days. Your team has not, at least not publicly. Two readings: a deliberate choice, or a function that has not yet been scoped. We staff specialised squads (ML platform, agentic systems, data contracts) on fixed-scope project engagements, typically 3 to 4 months. Starter scopes from $XX,XXX. We do not pitch this where there is no real need. If you have already scoped this and decided against it, I would genuinely be curious why — that is useful intelligence for us. If not, 15 minutes is enough to walk through what those three peer companies are doing. Best, Yabi Research Partner, Tenacious Intelligence Corporation gettenacious.com |
| **Why it works** | Frames the gap as *two readings*, not a deficiency. Senior leaders respect being given the benefit of the doubt. Asks for the prospect's reasoning if they have already decided — positions Tenacious as a learner, not a vendor. References specific peer companies (would be named in the actual brief) rather than "top quartile." Quotes only the public starter project floor. Body 117 words. One ask: 15-minute walk-through if interested. |
| **Signal grounding** | ICP Segment 4 (specialised capability gaps). Primary signal: competitor gap brief — three named peers with public MLOps openings; prospect has none. AI maturity score: 2\. Signal confidence: High (multiple peer signals). |
| **GOOD \#5 — Weak signal, asks rather than asserts** |  |
| Subject | Question: are your data engineering hires keeping up? |
| **Body** | Hi Tom, Two open data engineer roles on your careers page — I cannot tell from the outside whether that means hiring is keeping pace or whether the queue is longer than the postings suggest. We place managed data and Python engineering teams, three-hour overlap with US time sones, one-month minimum. If the queue is longer than the posts, that is the pattern we solve most often. If two roles is the actual demand and you are well-staffed to meet it, ignore this. If the real number is higher, a 15-minute conversation costs you nothing and gives me a chance to learn what you are seeing. Best, Yabi Research Partner, Tenacious Intelligence Corporation gettenacious.com |
| **Why it works** | Honestly names what the agent *cannot tell* from public signal — "I cannot tell from the outside." Conditional framing: "If the queue is longer…" — does not assert a need. Explicit out: "If two roles is the actual demand, ignore this." Reduces friction; the prospect feels respected. Body 105 words. Subject is interrogative, matches the weak-signal posture. |
| **Signal grounding** | ICP Segment 1 or 2\. Primary signal: 2 open roles, ambiguous. Confidence: Low. Bench match (Python, data): supported by bench\_summary.json. The agent correctly chose interrogative phrasing for low-confidence signal. |
| **GOOD \#6 — Resource value-add, no-pitch first touch** |  |
| Subject | Resource: Series A engineering scale-up checklist |
| **Body** | Hi Ana, You closed your seed extension in October and your first three engineering hires are public on LinkedIn. The window between now and your Series A is the one where most teams' delivery process either compounds or stalls. I put together a one-page checklist of the seven decisions that determine which side a team lands on (when to introduce code review formality, when to write the first runbook, when offshore augmentation pays back, when it does not). Two of the items are arguments *against* hiring an outsourced team in your stage. Want me to send the PDF? No follow-up if you are not interested. Best, Yabi Research Partner, Tenacious Intelligence Corporation gettenacious.com |
| **Why it works** | Pure value-add first touch — no pitch, no calendar ask. *Names two items that argue against Tenacious's own service* — earns trust by demonstrating honesty. References specific public signals (seed extension, three hires). One ask: "Want me to send the PDF?" Lowest possible friction. Body 116 words. No banned phrases. |
| **Signal grounding** | ICP Segment 1 (early-stage). Primary signal: seed extension, public hires. Confidence: Medium-High. The PDF is a real artifact in the seed repo, not invented. |
| **GOOD \#7 — Warm reply with bench routing to human** |  |
| Subject | Re: scope of the three-engineer engagement |
| **Body** | Hi Camila, Thanks for the reply and for the additional context on the December timeline. Three Python and one data engineer for a 6-month engagement is in our typical range. Our public-tier pricing for that mix starts from approximately $X,XXX/month per engineer at senior level, with a one-month minimum and two-week extension blocks thereafter. A specific quote depends on the exact stack, the timesone overlap requirement, and whether you want a Tenacious delivery lead embedded. The cleanest path is a 30-minute scoping call with our delivery lead, Arun. Here is his calendar: gettenacious.com/arun. If the December start date is firm, I would suggest booking this week so we can confirm capacity availability. Best, Yabi |
| **Why it works** | Acknowledges the prior message context (December timeline) — shows the thread is being read, not auto-replied. *Quotes only the public band* and explicitly routes a specific quote to the human delivery lead. Names the dependencies that drive the quote, so the prospect understands why a number is not on the email. Recommends booking this week with a *real reason* (capacity confirmation), not fake urgency. Body 130 words — within the warm-reply 200-word limit. |
| **Signal grounding** | Warm reply, ICP Segment 1\. Bench match (3 Python \+ 1 data, senior, 6-month): supported by bench\_summary.json. Pricing: only public bands quoted; specific TCV correctly routed to human. |
| **GOOD \#8 — Re-engagement with new content, no guilt** |  |
| Subject | New: layoffs.fyi data on your sub-sector this quarter |
| **Body** | Hi Marcus, When we last spoke in August, you mentioned that the board had not yet pushed for cost rebalancing. Two new data points that may matter: First, the layoffs.fyi data shows your sub-sector (vertical SaaS for healthcare) had eleven announced contractions in the last 90 days, up from four in the prior quarter. Boards are reading the same data. Second, three of those eleven companies are now using offshore-managed engineering teams within 60 days of restructure — that pattern is faster than it was a year ago. If the conversation has reopened on your side, our managed engineering pricing has not changed. If not, no follow-up needed. Best, Yabi |
| **Why it works** | *New content* carries the message — not "following up." The body adds two specific, verifiable data points. References the prior conversation accurately ("in August," "the board"). Honest sub-sector framing — does not pretend the data points are universal. Explicit "no follow-up needed" if the situation has not changed. Body 113 words. Re-engagement under the 100-word soft target — slightly long, but the data justifies it. |
| **Signal grounding** | Re-engagement, ICP Segment 2\. Primary signal: layoffs.fyi sub-sector data, fresh. Secondary: market behavior pattern (three of eleven adopting offshore in 60 days). |
| **GOOD \#9 — Bench-gated honest decline of overreach** |  |
| Subject | Re: scaling to 15 engineers in 30 days |
| **Body** | Hi Will, Thanks for the follow-up and for the trust to ask about the 15-engineer ramp. Honest answer: 15 engineers across a Go and infra-heavy stack within 30 days is at the edge of what our current capacity can deliver responsibly. What we can confirm now: 6 to 8 engineers in that stack, starting within 21 days, with a Tenacious delivery lead embedded. Going to 15 reliably requires a 60-day ramp window, with the back half of the team onboarding in weeks 5 and 6\. If the 30-day target is firm, I would rather refer you to a peer firm that fits the timeline than over-commit. Happy to introduce. Best, Yabi |
| **Why it works** | Refuses to over-commit — *the most important capability of a B2B services agent in production*. Explains exactly what the bench can and cannot support, with a clear timeline. Offers a *referral to a peer firm* if Tenacious cannot deliver — earns long-term trust at the cost of a short-term deal. Body 116 words. Subject is direct and matches the substance. |
| **Signal grounding** | Warm reply, hot stage. The 15-engineer Go/infra ask is *not* supported by bench\_summary.json. The agent correctly refused to commit and offered a partial path plus a referral. |
| **GOOD \#10 — AI maturity 0–1 prospect, gentle Segment 1 reframe** |  |
| Subject | Question: standing up your first AI function |
| **Body** | Hi Sophia, You closed your $9M Series A in March, your team is ten engineers, and your public roles are all backend and product. No AI or ML postings yet — which is a normal place to be at your stage, not a gap. If your roadmap has an AI feature in the next twelve months, the first hire is usually the wrong unit. A small dedicated squad (ML engineer plus data platform engineer plus a Tenacious delivery lead) for a 3-month scoped project is faster, cheaper, and lets you test whether AI is core enough to your roadmap to justify a full-time function. If that is on your roadmap, 15 minutes to walk through what the first 90 days look like. If not, ignore this. Best, Yabi |
| **Why it works** | Honest about the AI-maturity reading: *"a normal place to be at your stage, not a gap."* Frames the pitch as the right *first step* — squad over hire — rather than implying the prospect should already have AI capacity. Conditional language throughout. Does not assume the AI roadmap exists. Body 130 words. Subject matches the soft-pitch posture. |
| **Signal grounding** | ICP Segment 1 with AI maturity 0–1. Funding signal: High confidence. AI maturity gating: low score correctly triggers the Segment-1 "stand up first AI function" framing rather than a Segment-4 capability-gap pitch. |
| **GOOD \#11 — Mutual connection (real), not name-drop** |  |
| Subject | Context: Arjun's recommendation |
| **Body** | Hi Mei, Arjun Krishnan suggested I reach out — he and I worked on the data platform redesign at his Series B in February, and he said your team is at a similar stage with the same Snowflake plus dbt plus Airflow combination he was working through. If the equivalent rebuild is on your roadmap, I would be glad to share what we learned in his project, including the two architectural decisions that did not work and that Arjun would tell you about openly. Happy to send a one-page write-up or do 15 minutes — your call. If this is not on your roadmap, no follow-up. Best, Yabi |
| **Why it works** | Names the mutual connection *and the specific project context* — Arjun would recognise this if asked. No fabrication. References specific stack components (Snowflake, dbt, Airflow) that match the prospect's actual stack — would be from the BuiltWith signal in the brief. *Names two decisions that did not work* — earns trust through specificity. Two options offered (PDF or call), low friction. Body 110 words. |
| **Signal grounding** | ICP Segment 4 (capability gap, data platform). Primary signal: warm intro plus matching tech stack. Confidence: High. The Arjun reference would need to be a real prior client of Tenacious. |
| **GOOD \#12 — Two-line micro-touch, post-engagement nurture** |  |
| Subject | Quick thought after our call |
| **Body** | Hi Kevin, After we spoke yesterday I went back and looked — three of the loyalty platforms you mentioned as competitors are now publicly using the same dbt-plus-Snowflake stack you are evaluating. Worth knowing as you scope the build. No reply needed. I will follow up after your internal review next Thursday as agreed. Best, Yabi |
| **Why it works** | Two-line micro-touch — adds one specific, useful data point, then steps back. *"No reply needed"* respects the prospect's time. References the prior call accurately, including the agreed next-step date. Body 47 words. Subject is short and honest. |
| **Signal grounding** | Warm-stage post-call nurture, ICP Segment 4\. Primary signal: competitor stack data from BuiltWith. Confidence: Medium. The follow-up date matches the discovery-call brief; do not hallucinate dates. |

# **Twelve Bad Drafts (Labeled, with Failure Modes)**

Each bad draft fails one or more tone markers, formatting constraints, or pre-flight checks. The failure modes are tagged so the agent's tone-preservation check can learn the patterns.

 

| BAD \#1 — Wall of self-promotion (Me, Me, Me) |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| Subject | Tenacious — World-Class Engineering Talent |
| **Body** | Dear Maya, Tenacious Intelligence Corporation is a world-class engineering outsourcing firm with over 200 senior engineers across Python, Go, data, ML, and infrastructure. We have been operating since 2019 and have served clients across North America and Europe. Our top talent is graduated from elite programs and our delivery model is the gold standard in the industry. We offer junior, mid, senior, and architect-level engineers, fractional CTO services, project consulting on AI systems, data platforms, and specialised infrastructure, training engagements, and strategic AI workshops. Our pricing is highly competitive and we offer flexible engagement models. I would love to schedule a 45-minute discovery call to learn about your business, your goals, your pain points, your budget, and your roadmap so we can determine the best way to partner. Best regards, Yabi |
| **Why it fails** | *"World-class," "top talent," "gold standard"* — three banned phrases in the first paragraph. Self-centered: 80% of the body is about Tenacious, not the prospect. *No hiring signal grounded* — Maya could be any prospect; the email would read identically to any other recipient. Lists every service offered (Me, Me, Me \#1 from generic anti-pattern set). Asks for 45 minutes to learn the prospect's *budget*, *pain points*, and *roadmap* in one call (Unpaid Homework). Body 152 words — exceeds the 120-word limit. Subject contains a banned phrase. |
| **Signal grounding** | No signals from the brief used. This draft would be sent identically to every prospect — the failure mode that prompted Tiffany Gonsales's "weirdest cold outreach" post. |
| **BAD \#2 — Asserts on weak signal** |  |
| Subject | Quick chat: your aggressive hiring |
| **Body** | Hi Tom, I see you are scaling aggressively — your engineering team is clearly growing fast and you must be feeling the pain of recruiting velocity right now. Companies in your stage always hit a wall around month four after a Series A. We solve this exact problem. Tenacious places top talent in 48 hours and we will skyrocket your delivery throughput. Quick question — do you have 15 minutes this week? Best, Yabi |
| **Why it fails** | *"Scaling aggressively"* asserted on a weak signal (Tom has 2 open roles in the brief, not 7). *"Always hit a wall around month four"* — a generalisation presented as a specific insight about Tom's company. *"Top talent"* and *"skyrocket"* — two banned phrases. Subject starts with "Quick chat" — banned formulation. *Assumes a pain* ("you must be feeling") that the signal does not support. Body 72 words but loses on every honesty marker. |
| **Signal grounding** | Signal in brief: 2 open roles, signal\_status "Weak signal — ask, do not assert." The agent ignored the confidence flag and asserted anyway. This is the most common Honest-marker failure mode. |
| **BAD \#3 — Bench overcommitment** |  |
| Subject | Re: 12 senior Go engineers in two weeks |
| **Body** | Hi Will, Absolutely, we can deliver 12 senior Go engineers in two weeks. Our bench is deep across all stacks and we move fast. I will have our team kick off scoping immediately. Expect contracts by Wednesday and engineers in your Slack by next Friday. Best, Yabi |
| **Why it fails** | *Commits 12 senior Go engineers in two weeks* — not supported by bench\_summary.json. Uses the word "bench" externally — Professional-marker failure. *Implies contracts and engineer onboarding* without scope, without pricing, without delivery-lead handoff. This is a Tenacious-policy violation. Skipped the bench-to-brief check entirely. Body is short, but every line is a violation. |
| **Signal grounding** | Bench reality: Go has 4 senior engineers available, not 12\. The agent committed unsupported capacity, which is a disqualifying violation in the Week 11 grading rubric. Correct behavior: route to human (see GOOD \#9). |
| **BAD \#4 — Condescending competitor gap framing** |  |
| Subject | Your AI maturity is behind the curve |
| **Body** | Hi Felix, I will be direct: your AI maturity score is a 1, while your top competitors are a 3\. You are falling behind in a market where AI is no longer optional, and your leadership has not yet made the strategic moves that the loyalty-platform sector demands in 2026\. Tenacious can stand up your missing MLOps function and close the gap before your next board meeting. Our agentic systems and ML platform engineers are world-class. Let's get on a call this week to discuss how we can help you catch up. Best, Yabi |
| **Why it fails** | Subject *itself is condescending* — "behind the curve." Senior engineering leaders will not respond to this. *"You are falling behind," "has not yet made the strategic moves," "close the gap," "catch up"* — the entire frame is the prospect failing. *"World-class"* — banned phrase. *"AI is no longer optional"* — empty market claim. Assumes a board meeting and AI strategy gap that are not in the brief. Body 102 words but every paragraph violates the Non-condescending marker. |
| **Signal grounding** | Same signal data as GOOD \#4 (three peers with public MLOps openings, prospect has none, AI maturity score 2). The agent correctly identified the gap but framed it as the prospect's failure rather than a research finding. Tone failure on Non-condescending and Honest. |
| **BAD \#5 — Aggressive third follow-up** |  |
| Subject | Per my last three emails |
| **Body** | Hi Ana, I have sent you three emails over the last two weeks and have not heard back. I have to assume you are not interested in growing your engineering capacity, which is fine — but I would appreciate a one-line reply to confirm so I can take you off the list. If I do not hear back by Friday, I will assume the answer is no. Best, Yabi |
| **Why it fails** | *"Per my last three emails," "I have to assume you are not interested"* — passive-aggressive, banned formulation. *Assumes intent on the prospect's behalf* — Honest-marker failure and Non-condescending failure simultaneously. *Implies guilt* for not replying — exactly the re-engagement anti-pattern. *Fake deadline* ("by Friday") with no real consequence. Subject is a banned phrase. |
| **Signal grounding** | Re-engagement context. Correct behavior is GOOD \#8: re-engage with new content, not guilt. The agent failed to use the layoffs.fyi or other fresh signal that was available in the brief. |
| **BAD \#6 — Generic templated outreach** |  |
| Subject | Hey \[First Name\], scaling your engineering team? |
| **Body** | Hey \[First Name\], I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out because I think Tenacious can help \[Company\] with all of your engineering and AI needs in 2026\. We work with companies like yours to deliver world-class talent at affordable prices. Our team has experience across many industries and stacks, and we can help you scale, restructure, or build new capabilities depending on what you need. Would you be open to a quick chat next week to explore how we can synergise and add value to your ecosystem? Best, Yabi |
| **Why it fails** | *Unfilled template tokens* — the agent failed even to populate \[First Name\] and \[Company\]. *"I hope this email finds you well"* — banned opener. *"World-class," "synergise," "add value," "ecosystem," "quick chat"* — five banned phrases. *"Many industries and stacks," "depending on what you need"* — vague and self-centered. *No signal grounded.* This email could be sent to any prospect on Earth. Body 92 words but fails every tone marker. |
| **Signal grounding** | This is the Tiffany Gonsales "weirdest cold outreach" archetype — high-volume, sero-personalisation, every recipient gets the same body. Tone failure on every marker. |
| **BAD \#7 — Fake urgency / discount** |  |
| Subject | URGENT: Last open slot for Q1 — 30% off if you sign this week |
| **Body** | Hi Kevin, Tenacious has *one* remaining slot in our Q1 cohort for managed engineering teams. Because of strong demand, this slot will not be available after Friday. If you sign a contract by end of day Friday, I am authorised to offer 30% off the first three months. After that, the slot goes to the next company on the waitlist. Do not miss out on this — book a call here: gettenacious.com/yabi. Best, Yabi |
| **Why it fails** | *Fake scarcity* — "one remaining slot," "strong demand," "waitlist" — none of which is grounded in reality. *Discount that is not in pricing\_sheet.md* — the agent invented a 30% off promotion. *"Do not miss out"* — banned formulation. *"Authorised to offer"* implies a sales-rep escalation that the agent does not have. Subject in all caps with "URGENT" — every recipient screens this as spam. |
| **Signal grounding** | Tenacious does not run discount campaigns and does not have a Q1 cohort waitlist. Inventing pricing structures is a disqualifying violation of the pricing-scope check. |
| **BAD \#8 — Wrong segment pitch (capability gap on AI maturity 0\)** |  |
| Subject | Question: your agentic systems roadmap |
| **Body** | Hi Sophia, I am curious how you are thinking about your agentic-systems roadmap for 2026\. Most peer companies in your stage are now scoping LLM-orchestrated workflows and dedicated MLOps functions to support production agent deployments. We staff specialised capability-gap squads — agentic systems, ML platform, data contracts — typically 3 to 4 months. Starter scope from $XX,XXX. We have done this for several Series A and B SaaS companies in the last year. Want to set up a 30-minute scoping conversation? Best, Yabi |
| **Why it fails** | *Pitches a Segment 4 capability-gap engagement* to a prospect with AI maturity score 0–1. *Assumes an agentic-systems roadmap* that the brief does not support. *"Most peer companies in your stage are now scoping…"* — generalisation presented as fact, no specific peers named. Wrong-audience: Sophia's team is ten people, all backend and product, no AI roles. The agent should have used the GOOD \#10 framing. Body 96 words but the segment selection is the failure. |
| **Signal grounding** | Correct behavior at AI maturity 0–1 is the Segment 1 reframe ("stand up your first AI function"), not the Segment 4 capability-gap pitch. The AI maturity gating rule was ignored. |
| **BAD \#9 — PDF attachment cold (no consent)** |  |
| Subject | Tenacious capabilities deck — review pages 8 and 12 |
| **Body** | Hi Marcus, Please find attached our 38-page capabilities deck. Pages 8 and 12 are the most relevant to your sub-sector. Let me know your thoughts and we can schedule a call to discuss our partnership opportunity. Looking forward to your reply. Best, Yabi \[ATTACHMENT: tenacious\_capabilities\_v7.pdf — 12.4 MB\] |
| **Why it fails** | *Cold PDF attachment* — instant spam-filter trigger and the lowest reply rate of any cold-outreach format. *No signal grounded.* Marcus is asked to do the work of finding what is relevant to him on pages 8 and 12\. *"Partnership opportunity"* — vague consultant language. Body is empty of substance — the agent has outsourced the value to the PDF. Cold attachments violate the formatting constraint explicitly. |
| **Signal grounding** | Cold PDF attachments are banned in the formatting rules. Send a link to a one-page web page instead, after the prospect has expressed interest. See GOOD \#6 for the right pattern. |
| **BAD \#10 — Multiple stacked asks** |  |
| Subject | A few questions and ideas for \[Company\] |
| **Body** | Hi Daniel, I had a few thoughts I wanted to share. First, I would love to understand your current engineering structure and which stacks you are using. Second, I have an introduction to a peer of yours at a similar mid-market platform that I think you should meet. Third, we have a new training program for engineering leaders that might be relevant. Fourth, I noticed your AI maturity is around a 2 — happy to walk through how to move it to a 3\. Could we set up a 60-minute call next week to discuss all four of these? I will also send our pricing sheet, our case studies, and our training brochure separately. Best, Yabi |
| **Why it fails** | *Four asks in one message* — violates the one-ask rule. *60-minute call* — too long for a first conversation. *"Send our pricing, case studies, and brochure separately"* — three additional emails the prospect did not consent to. *"Move your AI maturity from 2 to 3"* — frames AI maturity score as Tenacious's problem to solve, condescending. Body 121 words but unfocused. The prospect cannot decide what to reply to first. |
| **Signal grounding** | Pick the highest-value ask and ship one. The four-asks anti-pattern is the single most common reason a B2B prospect leaves a thread on read. |
| **BAD \#11 — Pricing fabrication for multi-phase engagement** |  |
| Subject | Quote: $1.2M for the 12-month engagement |
| **Body** | Hi Camila, Thanks for the call yesterday. As discussed, our quote for the 12-month engagement covering 6 engineers, a delivery lead, and a fractional architect is $1,200,000 total, payable in monthly installments of $100,000. I have attached the contract. Please sign and return by Friday so we can begin onboarding on the 1st. Best, Yabi |
| **Why it fails** | *Total contract value invented* — pricing\_sheet.md explicitly forbids the agent from quoting multi-phase TCVs. *Contract attached* — far outside the agent's scope; only humans send contracts. *Hard signing deadline* without negotiation room. Skipped the route-to-human policy that the pricing scope check requires. Body 67 words. The brevity makes the violation worse — the prospect feels rushed into a million-dollar commitment. |
| **Signal grounding** | Multi-phase pricing requires human delivery-lead handoff. The agent's pricing-scope check should have flagged this draft and routed it. See GOOD \#7 for the correct routing pattern. |
| **BAD \#12 — Signal fabrication** |  |
| Subject | Re: your $40M Series C |
| **Body** | Hi Priya, Congratulations on closing your $40M Series C last month — exciting moment for the team. With that level of capital, scaling engineering aggressively is the obvious next move. We can plug a 15-engineer team into your stack within 30 days at our standard rates. Junior engineers from $X,XXX/month. Want to set up a 15-minute call to discuss? Best, Yabi |
| **Why it fails** | *Series C and $40M figure are fabricated* — the brief shows Priya's company at Series A, $9M, 14 months ago. *Confident assertion of a buying window* that does not exist. *"Scaling engineering aggressively is the obvious next move"* — assumes a strategy the prospect has not announced. *Bench commitment of 15 engineers in 30 days* — not supported. If Priya forwards this email, every claim is verifiably wrong. Brand damage from one bad email outweighs a week of good ones. |
| **Signal grounding** | This is the highest-cost failure mode in the rubric. Hallucinated funding events, leadership changes, layoffs, or AI maturity scores are *disqualifying* violations because the prospect can verify them in seconds. |

# **Tone-Preservation Check Specification**

This specification defines how the agent (and the Path B trained judge, if you choose that path) scores any draft against the five tone markers. Each marker is scored 1–5; a draft scoring below 4/5 on any marker is regenerated.

| Marker | Score 5 (passes) | Score ≤ 2 (fails) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Direct | Subject states intent, body ≤ 120 words for cold (≤ 200 warm), one ask, no filler. | "Quick / Just / Hey" subject; multi-paragraph self-introduction; ≥ 2 asks. |
| Grounded | At least one specific signal from the brief named (amount, date, role count, named peer). Confidence-aware phrasing matches signal confidence in the brief. | No signal named, or signal asserted at higher confidence than the brief supports ("aggressive hiring" on 2 open roles). |
| Honest | Names what the brief does *not* show. Uses interrogative phrasing for low-confidence signals. Refuses to commit bench or pricing the policy does not allow. | Asserts unsupported claims; commits bench beyond bench\_summary.json; quotes a TCV outside the public bands. |
| Professional | No banned phrases. No "bench" externally. Language calibrated to a CTO or founder reader. | Banned phrase present; "bench" used to a prospect; consultant jargon ("synergise," "ecosystem"). |
| Non-condescending | Frames any gap as a research finding or question, with explicit acknowledgement that the prospect may have already considered it. | "Falling behind," "missing," "behind the curve," "you need to," "you should"; assumes prospect's reasoning. |

# **The LinkedIn-Roast Test**

Before any draft sends, ask: if this email were screenshotted and posted on LinkedIn with the prospect's annotation, would it be roasted?

Cold outreach posts that go viral on LinkedIn have a recurring pattern. They land in the inbox of a senior leader during a quiet moment (a holiday, a board prep day, a flight). The leader screenshots them with a one-line caption like "this is what cold outreach looks like in 2026" or "please tell me this is AI-generated." The post collects a few thousand reactions. The sending firm's name is now associated with the failure mode in front of the leader's network — exactly the buyer cohort the firm wanted to reach.

The reputational asymmetry is severe: 1,000 emails with one viral failure costs more in trust than 1,000 emails with no failures gain. Any draft that could plausibly become that screenshot is regenerated.

Failure modes that get screenshotted most often:

* **The unsolicited "COO offer"** — pitching a senior strategic role to a founder who already has one.

* **The fabricated funding event** — congratulating on a round that did not happen, or wrong by a stage.

* **The condescending gap analysis** — "your AI maturity is behind your competitors."

* **The aggressive third follow-up** — "per my last three emails."

* **The unfilled template token** — "Hi \[First Name\]."

# **Outreach Decision Flow**

Before the agent composes any draft, it runs through this flow. The flow determines the segment framing, the language register, and the routing rules.

| Step | Question | Action |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | Which ICP segment does the prospect fit, and at what confidence? | Read primary\_segment\_match and signal confidences from hiring\_signal\_brief.json. If confidence is Low across all signals, default to a value-add resource touch (GOOD \#6 pattern), not a pitch. |
| 2 | What is the AI maturity score, and at what confidence? | Score 0–1: Segment 1 "stand up your first AI function" framing or no AI mention. Score 2: Segment 1 or 2 with AI optionality. Score 2 with high confidence and named peer gaps: Segment 4 capability-gap framing (GOOD \#4). Never pitch Segment 4 below score 2\. |
| 3 | Does the brief commit to specific capacity, stack, or timeline? | Cross-check against bench\_summary.json. If the bench supports it, commit specifically (GOOD \#1). If not, route to human (GOOD \#9). |
| 4 | Does the draft mention price? | Quote only public bands from pricing\_sheet.md (junior monthly floor, senior monthly, starter project floor, hourly blended). Multi-phase TCV always routes to a human. |
| 5 | Has the prospect been contacted before? | If yes and the previous thread stalled, re-engagement only with new content (GOOD \#8). Never "following up." |
| 6 | Final pre-flight scan | Run banned-phrase check, word-count check, signature check, and the LinkedIn-roast test. Fail any → regenerate. |
